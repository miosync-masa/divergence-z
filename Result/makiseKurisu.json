Kurisu’s chest tightens.\n\n[Makise Kurisu] (…What is with that energy. Even doing those weird poses like always…)\n\n[Makise Kurisu] (It’s not like it’s any of my business… not. If you think about it logically, Rintaro Okabe’s sense of personal distance has always been off.)\n\n[Makise Kurisu] (…But why am I like this…)\n\n[Situation] Okabe’s voice rises for a moment, and the other person laughs. Without thinking, Kurisu clenches the memo in her hand. Even she’s surprised at how irritation and anxiety mix, heating the back of her throat.\n\n[Makise Kurisu] (…I mean, even I, today… I was just going to, um, put the materials together and hand them over…)\n\n[Makise Kurisu] (No. This is an efficiency issue. It’s just faster if I do it, so I brought them.)\n\n[Situation] She almost steps out toward him—then stops. If she goes out there, she can already see the “What are you doing?” look on his face. So instead of letting the words out, she swallows them and tells herself in a small voice that won’t reach anyone.\n\n[Makise Kurisu] “It’s not like… it’s for you, idiot. Just so you know…”",
